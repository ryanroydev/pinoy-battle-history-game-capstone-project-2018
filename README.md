## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Trivia-based Combat**:  
  The game follows a unique trivia-based combat system. Each battle is divided into turns where the player will face a question from one of three eras in Philippine history: **Spanish**, **Japanese**, or **American**.

- **Answering Questions**:  
  At the start of each turn, the player will be presented with a trivia question related to the selected era. The player has a limited time to answer the question correctly.

  - **Correct Answer**:  
    If the player answers correctly, their character (the national hero) gains the strength to attack. The attack can be a physical strike or a special ability, depending on the hero’s unique traits.
  
  - **Incorrect Answer**:  
    If the player answers incorrectly, the folklore creature will counter-attack. The creature uses its own powers or special attacks to deal damage to the player’s character.

- **Attack Mechanics**:  
  Each national hero and folklore creature has unique abilities that are powered up by correct answers. The strength of the attack or defense depends on how well the player performs during the trivia phase.
  
  - **Heroes**: Each hero has a special move that can be unlocked by correctly answering consecutive questions. For example, **Gabriela Silang** might unleash a powerful cavalry charge, **Apolinario Mabini** could use strategic defense skills, **Lapu-Lapu** might summon a fierce battle move, and **Jose Rizal** could use his intelligence to deal a devastating strategic blow.

  - **Folklore Creatures**: When attacking, the folklore creatures will retaliate with their own abilities, such as the **Tiktik** using its blood-sucking ability or the **Manangal** unleashing a deadly flight attack.

- **Health and Damage**:  
  Each character (both heroes and folklore creatures) has a health bar. Correct answers by the player will increase the character's attack power, while incorrect answers will increase the folklore creature's attack. The goal is to reduce the opponent's health to zero while maintaining your own hero's health.

- **Level Progression**:  
  As the player progresses through the game, the difficulty of the trivia questions increases, and the folklore creatures become stronger. The player must answer questions from more challenging periods in history, while facing more aggressive enemies.

- **Victory Conditions**:  
  The player wins the battle by answering enough questions correctly to defeat the folklore creature. If the folklore creature's health reaches zero, the player progresses to the next level. Conversely, if the player’s character's health drops to zero, the player loses the battle.
